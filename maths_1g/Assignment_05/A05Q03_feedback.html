<p>
    We perform the following row operations, which reveal a zero coefficient row.<br>
    \(
        {@mat_seq[1]@}....
    )<br>
    <br>
    Since we have a zero coefficient row, the coefficient matrix is not full rank and so there is no value of \(k\) for which the system has a unique solution.<br>
    If the right hand side of the zero coefficient row is non-zero, then the system has no solutions, since \(0 = A \neq 0 \) can never happen.<br>
    Therefore, if there is to be any solution, we require {@poly = 0@}, or \(k \in {@{root_1, root_2}@}\).<br>
    If \(k \nin {@{root_1, root_2}@}\) then the system has no solution.
